        Picture yourself walking through a beautiful forest. The sun is out; there's a perfect breeze. It's just beautiful. Who are you walking with? As you continue in your walk through the forest, you come across an animal. What kind of animal is it? You're walking deeper into the woods, and you come to a clearing. There's house in the middle of the clearing. How big is it? Is it fenced or not?
